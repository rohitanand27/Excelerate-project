Data Cleaning
Data cleaning is the process of identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in datasets to ensure that the data is accurate, reliable, and suitable for analysis. 

It involves handling missing values, correcting formatting issues, addressing outliers, and standardizing data to improve its quality. The primary goals of data cleaning are to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the dataset, leading to more robust and meaningful analyses.

Key Aspects of Data Cleaning
Handling Missing Values: Identifying and dealing with missing data, either by imputing values based on statistical methods or removing observations with missing data. A useful resource for understanding missing data handling is this
Be careful when handling missing values in this data set, as they may have been intentionally omitted (not added by the user)

Handling Outliers: Identifying and addressing data points that deviate significantly from the majority, which could distort analysis results.

Standardizing Formats: Ensuring consistency in data formats, such as dates, units of measurement, and categorical variables.

Correcting Errors: Identifying and correcting any errors in the dataset, including typographical errors, inaccuracies, or inconsistencies. This is a common occurrence in the given data set. For example, some learners when indicating their city might type st. louis, while others might input Saint Louis- while both values intended to indicate the same information they will show up differently in our data analysis. Another example is that some users type random majors such as xxxhhyy). Be mindful to check and make corrections in this data.

Dealing with Duplicates: Identifying and removing duplicate records to avoid redundancy and ensure data integrity.

Handling Inconsistent Categorical Data: Standardizing categories and resolving discrepancies in categorical variables. All values in a particular column should follow the same format

Data Validation
Data validation is the process of ensuring that the data adheres to predefined standards and rules, confirming its accuracy, consistency, and reliability. It involves checking the integrity of the data against expected criteria or business rules. Validation aims to identify and correct any deviations or errors that might compromise the quality of the data.

Key Aspects in Data Validation


Tip- Check this guide to know more about validating formats.

Both data cleaning and validation are essential steps in the data preparation process, ensuring that the data used for analysis is of high quality, reliable, and aligned with the intended objectives of the analysis or business processes.

Performing Data Cleaning and Validation
Performing data cleaning and validation involves a systematic approach to ensure that the dataset is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis. Here is a step-by-step guide:



By following these steps, you can systematically perform data cleaning and validation, ensuring the dataset's quality and reliability for subsequent analysis.
